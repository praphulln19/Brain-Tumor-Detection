# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

> *Leveraging the power of AI to assist in early brain tumor detection through MRI image analysis*

## 🌟 Overview

This project represents a cutting-edge approach to medical image analysis, utilizing deep learning techniques to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans. Our mission is to create an accessible, accurate, and reliable tool that can assist healthcare professionals in early tumor detection, potentially saving lives through timely diagnosis.

### 🎯 What This Project Does

Our AI-powered system analyzes MRI brain scans and classifies them into four categories:
- **Glioma** - A type of tumor that occurs in the brain and spinal cord
- **Meningioma** - Tumors that arise from the meninges (membranes surrounding the brain)
- **Pituitary Tumor** - Growths that develop in the pituitary gland
- **No Tumor** - Healthy brain scans with no detectable tumors

## 🚀 Features

- **🔬 Advanced Deep Learning**: Utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks
